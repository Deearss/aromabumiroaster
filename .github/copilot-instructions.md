# Project: aromabumiroaster

This project is a Next.js application set up with the following technologies and conventions:

- **Next.js**: Using the App Router with TypeScript.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety throughout the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Version 4 or higher with custom coffee shop theme.
- **ESLint**: For code linting.
- **No `src` directory**: All application code is in the root `app` directory.
- **No import aliases**: All imports use relative paths.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration

The project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with a custom coffee shop color palette:

```css
@theme {
  /* Coffee Shop Color Palette */
  --color-primary: #2a1a10; /* Dark brown, like coffee */
  --color-primary_dark: #110c08; /* Very dark brown, like black coffee */
  --color-secondary: #f0ebe3; /* Warm cream, like latte foam */
  --color-accent: #8d6e63; /* Light brown, for buttons and links */
  --color-text: #333333; /* Very dark gray for main text */
}
```

Custom utilities are defined for common patterns:
- `@utility flexc` - flex items-center justify-center
- `@utility flexcc` - flex flex-col items-center justify-center
- `@utility clicked` - interactive cursor and scale effects
- `@utility transall` - standard transitions

### Navigation Icons & Structure

Current navbar layout (5 tabs centered):

### Asset Management

- **Videos**: `/video/falling_coffee_beans.mp4` with preload optimization
- **Images**: `/images/coffee_banner_menu.jpg` with progressive loading
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (headings) + Lato (body text)

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Video Loading**: Progressive download with progress tracking
2. **Image Preloading**: Critical assets preloaded in layout
3. **Animation Sequencing**: Optimized timing to prevent render blocking
4. **State Persistence**: Cart and animation states maintained across navigation
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with desktop enhancements

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Shopping Cart System**:

### Project Conventions

- **Client Components**: Explicitly marked with `"use client"` directive
- **Type Safety**: Shared types in `app/types.ts` (Product interface)
- **SEO Optimization**: Custom metadata for each page
- **Accessibility**: Focus management and keyboard navigation
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout

### Development Notes

- **No Floating Cart**: Cart button integrated into navbar for clean UX
- **Premium Aesthetic**: Film-era coffee shop inspired design
- **User-Friendly Cart**: No background blocking, allows browsing while shopping
- **Indonesian Focus**: All coffee products feature Indonesian origins and descriptions
- **Animation Sequences**: Complex timing for smooth user experience

When working on this project, maintain the established patterns for state management, component structure, and the premium coffee shop aesthetic.
